The folder for photo files is intended to be a directory, and it cannot contain file contents directly. Instead, you can create a placeholder file to indicate that this directory is meant for photo files. Hereâ€™s how you can structure it:

/portfolio-website/portfolio-website/src/subsites/project1/README.md

This file will serve as a placeholder to indicate that this directory is for photo files.

Contents of the file:

This directory is intended for photo files related to project1. Please add your images here.
